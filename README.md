# Tachi-Docs

This is the documentation for Tachi.

We host this on readthedocs, and you can find it [here](https://tachi.rtfd.io)!

# Setup

If you're in a horribly hellish python environment like me (Sorry Sera, you know its true) make sure you use `pip3`

- `pip install mkdocs`
- `git clone <this repo>`
- `pip install mkdocs-material`
- `cd repo`
- `mkdocs serve`

# Contributing

Fork the repository and PR your changes to `develop`.
