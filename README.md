# MKDocs-Template

My preferred defaults and a template for MKDocs, which is also my preferred engine for writing documentation.

# Setup

If you're in a horribly hellish python environment like me (Sorry Sera, you know its true) make sure you use `pip3`

- `pip install mkdocs`
- `git clone <this repo>`
- `pip install mkdocs-material`
- `mkdocs serve`
