# What's the difference between a PB and a Score?
A PB is all of your best scores on that chart joined together.

In most games, this means joining your best score with your best lamp.
Some games have some additional properties - like BP in IIDX and BMS - that
also need to be joined.

## Why bother?

It would *suck* if you could overwrite good scores with slightly worse ones,
and people would **NEVER** agree on what the primary metric for a games was.

If you got a better lamp on a chart in BMS, and it ruined your existing *sick*
score, that would be terrible!
