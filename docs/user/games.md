# Games

Tachi supports multiple games at the same time. It does
this using Games and Playtypes.

*****

## What's a playtype?

A playtype is a 'sub game' for a given game. For example,
DDR has two 'playtypes', one where the player plays on 4
panels, and one where the player plays on 8 panels.

For DDR, these are referred to as SP and DP - corresponding
to Single Play and Double Play.

Games **MUST** have playtypes, even if the game only has
one practical playtype!

For this scenario, the playtype `Single` is used, so for
something like SDVX, it would be SDVX Single.

### Why?

Playtypes are for separating different scores on the same
game, we don't want to get a user's DP scores mixed with
their SP scores as, for all intents and purposes, they are
completely separate games that need completely different
skills!

As for why games **MUST** have playtypes, it's generally
for futureproofing, and it works nicely with the codebase.

For games that don't *really* have multiple playtypes, this
fact is hidden in the UI, but might still poke up in URLs.
