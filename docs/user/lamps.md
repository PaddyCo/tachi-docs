# What are Lamps?

Lamps are a term borrowed mainly from Arcade rhythm games.

Their name is derived from the visual implementation in
IIDX and DDR, where a lamp would light up a specific
colour depending on your, well, lamp.

A synonym for this that might make more sense is "clear type", and some games use this name internally.

## Examples

In most games, you have a "FULL COMBO", which means you
didn't miss. That would be a different lamp to a "CLEAR",
which would be - well - a clear.

Another common lamp is "FAILED", which is exactly what
you think it would be.
