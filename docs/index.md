# Tachi Documentation

This site serves as the documentation for Tachi.

Tachi is a rhythm game score tracking engine, and is the name of the codebase that powers
both [Bokutachi](https://bokutachi.xyz) and [Kamaitachi](https://kamaitachi.xyz).

## About This Documentation

So that we don't have to write and maintain three separate sets of documentation, this site
works like a Monorepo for Tachi's documentation.

APIs and how they work.
