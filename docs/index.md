# Tachi Documentation

This site serves as the documentation for Tachi.

Tachi is a rhythm game score tracking engine, and is the name of the codebase that powers
both [Bokutachi](https://bokutachi.xyz) and [Kamaitachi](https://kamaitachi.xyz).

## About This Documentation

So that we don't have to write and maintain three separate sets of documentation, this site
works like a Monorepo for Tachi's documentation.

*****

### API Reference

This is for people who want to make things with Tachi's API, and assumes basic knowledge of
APIs and how they work.

!!! note
	The API reference overlaps a bit with the Codebase reference, mainly in
	the shape of various returned documents.
### Codebase Reference

This is for people who want to work on Tachi's codebase.
Tachi is wrote almost entirely in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

### User Reference

This is for end user reference, such as score importing tutorials, documentation on tachi's
statistics. It requires no programming knowledge, and is mostly used as a wiki-like reference.
